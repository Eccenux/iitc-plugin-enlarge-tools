# IITC plugin: Enlarge tools

This plugin aims to give you a better experience when using desktop mode on Firefox Mobile. Why use desktop mode? Because you can see more portals on the same zoom! Only problem is that you might find it very hard to tap on buttons. This plugin is here to help ;-).

See also: [my other IITC plugins](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AEccenux+iitc-plugin&type=Repositories).

Installation
------------

Assuming you already have IITC just &rarr; **[install the script](https://github.com/Eccenux/iitc-plugin-enlarge-tools/raw/master/enlarge-tools.user.js)**.

Usage
------------

Just switch to desktop mode (in FF options menu) and the plugin will enlarge buttons for you.

Below are two images from FF mobile with ITTC. First one is a standard (mobile) mode. Second one is the same phone in desktop mode (with this plugin installed). OK button of dialogs is also enlarged so it's easier to close them.

Using IITC on mobile FF
-----------------------

BTW. If you didn't know -- you can install and use [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) on FF Mobile since FF Quantum (that is since 2017-11-14).

Note that you need to install "desktop" IITC even on mobile FF: [iitc.me/desktop](https://iitc.me/desktop/). This is because the scripts are actually universal and they just switch from mobile to desktop mode depending on browser mode.

Oh, and yes - the synchronisation with [Sync plugin](https://iitc.me/desktop/#plugin-sync) works on FF mobile :-). As you can probably see above I'm using it for [Uniques](https://iitc.me/desktop/#plugin-uniques).
