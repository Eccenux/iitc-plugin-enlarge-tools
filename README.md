# IITC plugin: Enlarge tools

This plugin aims to give you a better experience when using desktop mode on Firefox Mobile. Why use desktop mode? Beacause you can see more portals on the same zoom! Only problem is that you might find it very hard to push buttons. This plugin is here to help ;-).

For now this means extra two buttons for switching between large (XL) and normal (N). I'll work on automatic switching later.

BTW. You can install [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) on FF Mobile since FF Quantum (that is since 2017-11-15). Note that you need to install "desktop" IITC for Tampermonkey: [iitc.me/desktop](https://iitc.me/desktop/). The scripts are actually universal they just switch from mobile to desktop mode depending on browser mode.
